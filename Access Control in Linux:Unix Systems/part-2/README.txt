register-patient:
"
As an administrator, write a shell script (register-patient.sh) which allows doctors to execute the script and register a new patient by creating the necessary patient file. The script asks the registering doctor to enter the patient’s basic personal information. The registering doctor becomes the primary doctor for the patient. Note: For the sake of simplicity, we assume there are no patients with duplicate information such as exact first name, last name and year of birth. Also you need to make sure nurses cannot register any new patients.
"

check-medication:
"
First create the two files RickSanchez1950 and SummerSmith2007 as described in the case study. You will need these to check your script! Then write a shell script (check-medication.sh) that allows nurses to display a list of past and current medi- cations and the date they were prescribed for a particular patient. The patient information (i.e. First Name, Last Name, and Year of Birth) is entered by the nurse. The information is displayed in the format shown in Fig. 3.
"

setup-clinic:
"
As an administrator, write a bash script setup-clinic.sh that does the
following:
• add the staff (doctors and nurses) as new users according to the information given in the case study.
• create any groups that are needed and set group memberships.
• create the directory structure of the clinic.
• adjust the ownership, permission, and potentially ACLs on files/directories.
